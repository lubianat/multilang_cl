# Multilingual Cell Ontology

This project adds multilingual labels to the Cell Ontology (CL) using data from Wikidata. The updated ontology file can be downloaded and used to enhance the multilingual capabilities of the Cell Ontology.

## Project Details

This project uses SPARQL queries to fetch labels from Wikidata for multiple languages and integrates these labels into the Cell Ontology. The languages included are:

- French
- Spanish
- German
- Portuguese
- Italian
- Arabic
- Greek
- Russian
- Japanese
- Chinese

## How It Works

1. **Fetching Labels**: SPARQL queries are used to fetch labels for various languages from Wikidata.
2. **Updating Ontology**: The fetched labels are integrated into the Cell Ontology file.
3. **Download**: The updated ontology file is available for download.

## Integration with Wikidata

Integration with Wikidata was done with the support of FAPESP grant #19/26284-1. For more details, visit the [project page](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/bolsas/193825/building-a-biological-knowledge-graph-via-wikidata-with-a-focus-on-the-human-cell-atlas/).

## Website

A simple static website is hosted on GitHub Pages to allow users to download the updated ontology file and learn more about the project.
